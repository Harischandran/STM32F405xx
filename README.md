# Contains the code to function test the led while using STM32F405xx
# To turn on and off the led
# To turn on the led sequentially with its respective switches
# To turn on the led serially using a single switch
# To turn on and off the led using the interlocking concept
# To turn on and off the led using the interchange concept
# To test the timers with delay(1s,0.5s,2s)
# To test the adc synchronized with a timer (adc 1 and timer 1 is used here, calibration is still needed but works)
# To test the PWM cycle using the led and timer1
